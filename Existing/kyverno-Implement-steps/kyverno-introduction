Understanding Kyverno
Kyverno is a powerful policy engine for Kubernetes governance, enabling DevOps teams to automate security, compliance, and best practices in a cloud-native environment. This README provides an overview of Kyverno, its features, and how it works.
What is Governance?
Governance ensures that all resources deployed in a Kubernetes cluster adhere to an organization's compliance policies and rules. For example:

Every Pod must have defined resource requests and limits to optimize resource utilization and prevent starvation.

Kyverno simplifies the enforcement of such governance rules through automation.
Admission Controllers in Kubernetes
Admission Controllers are Kubernetes components that intercept requests to the API Server before they are persisted in etcd (Kubernetes' database). They can:

Validate: Check if resources meet defined policies.
Mutate: Modify resources based on rules.

For example, an Admission Controller can reject or modify a Pod creation request if it lacks resource requests or limits.
In large organizations with numerous applications, managing custom Admission Controllers can be complex. Kyverno addresses this challenge.
What is Kyverno?
Kyverno (Greek for “govern”) is a cloud-native policy engine designed for Kubernetes. It automates security, compliance, and best practices, enabling secure self-service for application teams. While built for Kubernetes, Kyverno can also be used as a unified policy language outside of Kubernetes.
Key Features of Kyverno

Policies as YAML: Define policies declaratively using YAML, with no new language to learn.
Enforcement Options:
Kubernetes Admission Controller
CLI-based scanner
Runtime enforcement


Resource Management: Validate, mutate, generate, or clean up any Kubernetes resource.
Container Security: Verify container images and metadata for supply chain security.
Broad Policy Support: Apply policies to any JSON payload, including Terraform, cloud, or service authorization.
Exception Management: Flexible handling of policy exceptions.
Policy-as-Code: Manage policies using tools like Git and Kustomize.

How Kyverno Works
Kyverno operates as a Dynamic Admission Controller within the Kubernetes cluster:

The Kubernetes API Server sends validating or mutating admission webhook HTTP callbacks to Kyverno.
Kyverno evaluates the request against matching policies.
Based on the evaluation, Kyverno enforces, mutates, or rejects the resource request.

Policy Matching
Kyverno policies can target resources based on:

Resource kind, name, or namespace
Labels or selectors
Complex conditions or patterns

Policy Types
Mutating Policies

Automatically modify resources (similar to Kustomize overlays).
Support RFC 6902 JSON patches for precise changes.

Validating Policies

Validate resources using overlay-style syntax.
Support pattern matching and conditional logic (if–then–else).

Policy Reporting

Enforcement results are logged as Kubernetes events.
For resources that are allowed or predate a policy, Kyverno generates Policy Reports, providing:
A cluster-wide view of matched resources
Policy compliance status
Violations and recommendations



Summary
Kyverno empowers DevOps teams to:

Define compliance policies declaratively in YAML.
Automatically validate and enforce policies.
Ensure security and consistency across Kubernetes workloads.

By combining policy-as-code, security, and automation, Kyverno simplifies Kubernetes governance, making it effortless to maintain compliance and best practices.
