# 🧭 Understanding Kyverno

As a **DevOps Engineer**, one of your key responsibilities is to **manage the Kubernetes cluster** according to your organization’s **compliance policies and rules**.  
This process of ensuring that every deployed resource adheres to these standards is called **_governance_**.

---

## 🔍 What is Governance?

Every organization has certain **rules or compliance policies** that must be followed.  

For example:  
> Every Pod created inside the Kubernetes cluster should have proper resource requests and limits.

This rule ensures optimal resource utilization and prevents resource starvation.  
But how can these governance rules be **defined, enforced, and validated** automatically?

That’s where **Admission Controllers** come in.

## ⚙️ Admission Controllers in Kubernetes

Whenever a user performs an action like creating a Pod, Deployment, or Service, the request goes through the **Kubernetes API Server**.  

An **Admission Controller** is a component that intercepts these requests **before** they are persisted in etcd (the Kubernetes database).  
It can **validate** or **mutate** resources based on defined policies.

**Example use case:**
- When someone creates a Pod, the admission controller checks if it includes resource requests and limits.
- If not, the controller rejects or modifies the request before it gets created.

However, in large organizations with **hundreds or thousands of applications**, maintaining and distributing these custom admission controllers becomes complex.  

To solve this problem, we use **Kyverno**.

# 🚀 What is Kyverno?

**Kyverno** (Greek for “govern”) is a **cloud-native policy engine** designed for Kubernetes.  
It automates **security**, **compliance**, and **best practices validation**, enabling **secure self-service** for application teams.

Originally built for Kubernetes, Kyverno can now also be used **outside of Kubernetes** as a **unified policy language**.

---

## ✨ Key Features of Kyverno

- 📜 **Policies as YAML-based declarative resources** — no new language to learn  
- 🔐 **Policy enforcement** via:
  - Kubernetes **Admission Controller**
  - **CLI-based scanner**
  - **Runtime enforcement**
- 🔄 **Validate**, **mutate**, **generate**, or **cleanup** (remove) any Kubernetes resource  
- 🧩 **Verify container images and metadata** for software supply chain security  
- 🌍 **Policy support for any JSON payload**, including Terraform, cloud, or service authorization  
- ⚙️ **Flexible exception management** for policies  
- 🧠 **Manage policies as code** using familiar tools like **Git** and **Kustomize**

# 🧩 How Kyverno Works

Kyverno runs as a **Dynamic Admission Controller** inside the Kubernetes cluster.

1. The **Kubernetes API Server** sends **validating** and **mutating admission webhook** HTTP callbacks to Kyverno.
2. Kyverno applies the **matching policies**.
3. Based on the evaluation, it **enforces**, **mutates**, or **rejects** the incoming resource request.

---

## 🔧 Policy Matching

Kyverno policies can target resources based on:

- Resource **kind**, **name**, or **namespace**
- **Labels** or **selectors**
- Complex **conditions** or **patterns**

---

## 🧱 Policy Types

### 🌀 Mutating Policies
- Modify resources automatically (similar to Kustomize overlays)  
- Can use **RFC 6902 JSON patches**

### ✅ Validating Policies
- Validate resources using overlay-style syntax  
- Support **pattern matching** and **conditional logic (if–then–else)**

---

## 🪶 Policy Reporting

- Enforcement results are logged as **Kubernetes events**  
- For resources allowed or existing before a policy was created, Kyverno generates **Policy Reports**  
- These reports provide a **cluster-wide view** of:
  - Matched resources  
  - Policy compliance status  
  - Violations and recommendations  

---

# 📘 Summary

Kyverno simplifies **Kubernetes governance** by allowing DevOps teams to:

- Define compliance policies declaratively in YAML  
- Automatically validate and enforce them  
- Maintain security and consistency across all workloads  

> ✅ In short, Kyverno brings **policy-as-code**, **security**, and **automation** together — empowering DevOps teams to maintain governance effortlessly.
