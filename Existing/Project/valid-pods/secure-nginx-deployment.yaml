  //Policy Satisfied: Yes.

2. Image Verification (Trusted Registry):
  // nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:latest image is pulled from a trusted registry (nginxinc).
  // Policy Satisfied: Yes.

3. CPU and Memory Requests & Limits:
        CPU and memory are set with requests and limits:
            Requests: cpu: "200m", memory: "256Mi"
            Limits: cpu: "400m", memory: "512Mi"
        Policy Satisfied: Yes.

4. Privilege Escalation:
